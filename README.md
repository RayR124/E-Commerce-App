# E-Commerce-App
E-Commerce on the back-end for challenge 13

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/bower/l/MI?label=License&style=plastic)


## Description

- Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion annually. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit any full-stack web developer.

- My task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

- N/A 

## Usage

- Simply clone my GitHub Repository at https://github.com/RayR124/E-Commerce-App and make sure to have node, MySQL, and Sequelize on your system. This was made with Insomnia, but any other like-software will work just fine.

## Credits

- No Credits, but a huge thanks to Robbert Wijtman (GitHub @ Bucky24) for teaching me everything I know.

## Features

GIVEN a functional Express.js API

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands

THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
